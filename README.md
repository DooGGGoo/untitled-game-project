# About

Untitled game project I made quite a long time ago.

## Features
+ Godot's resource based weapon system (easy to add new weapons and edit their properties)
+ Advanced character controller, featuring smooth step handling, crouching, sprinting and jumping
+ Randomly generating missions
  + It can use the same map for multiple missions, and depending on the mission spawn required mission objectives
  + For example: 'Mission_1' on 'map_1' uses objective points **1, 2, 3**, and 'Mission_2' on 'map_1' uses objective points **1, 3**
+ Enemies with basic AI, Computer with in-world UI, other small features...

## Controls:
[LMB] - Shoot
[RMB] - ADS, throw prop
[1, 2] - Switch weapons
[E] - Use
[W, A, S, D] - Movement
[Space] - Jump
[Shift] - Sprint
[C] - Crouch
[F1] - (debug) Spawn Explosion
[F2] - (debug) Spawn Freedom™ Airstike™

## Notes

As for name of the project, it internally started as game set in SCP universe, but later I decided to scrap that idea and just make it a shooter with procedural mission system, but the name "scp game" is still remained in the codebase
